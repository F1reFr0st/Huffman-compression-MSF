# Huffman-compression-MSF
### Code was developed for compression of **_grayscale_** speckle images. 
## Huffman encoder
The task is to create .bin files corresponding to speckle images with only one table of values and keys. Therefore, first, array consisting of average intensity values  of all images is created. In the next step with implementation of **_huffmanenco_** function we create and save .bin file. Simultaniously, information about original image and compressed file sizes is displayed. Finally, when all data is compressed, total size of original and compressed files is displayed.
